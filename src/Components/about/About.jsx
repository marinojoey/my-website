                    Growing up I never imagined that I would have a desk job. I thought a life spent in front of a computer screen was incompatible with who I was. This ideology shaped my decisions through college and beyond- choosing degrees and paths that kept me "in the real world". That is until one day I had the same sort of realization many have: I get <strong className='bolded'>so much</strong> value, convenience, entertainment, productivity and general use out of technology that it very much is "the real world". The idea started to grow that maybe I should start learning it... and maybe even build something. <br></br> <br></br>
                    It was a good thought at least.       In reality I kept on going down the same path I had been: working "in the real world".

                    The turning point for me was when I started learning about Bitcoin. Specifically the humanitarian and philosophical components of it. Sitting in front of me was a highly technical protocol running a global network of computers. The realization that if I wanted to work in the "real world", one of the most meaningful ways that I could do that was via software hit me square in the head. <br></br> <br></br>
                    As a consequence, I quit my job and devoted myself to learning software development. Six months later, you've happened to stumble onto my humble website. I would love to hear from you if you would like to work together, have any feedback and especially if you want to share your favorite joke.
